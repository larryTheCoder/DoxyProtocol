# DoxyProtocol

[![Jenkins-CI](https://jenkins.potatohome.xyz/job/DoxyProtocol/badge/icon)](https://jenkins.potatohome.xyz/job/DoxyProtocol)

A passwordless client-server communication for WaterDogPE. It enforces SSL/TLS verification, securing the client-server
socket. My understanding about SSL is a bit low, however it does work flawlessly :)

This project was named as DragonNetProtocol, please pardon the classpath naming.

## Creating SSL certificates

The current SSL certificates is generated by myself, and is not secure as it is open to public, I recommend you to
change them. Creating an SSL certificate, self-signed, is fairly easy by using the command below:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:8192 -keyout private_key.key -out certificate.crt
```

Run this command in `/certificates` under DoxyProtocol plugin data folder.
